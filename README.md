### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I am Victor Vieira, a software developer with many passions. Not focused in specific tecnologies but in problems and how to solve them with the proper tehcnology. 

:books: I enjoy(a lot) reading and I really love(:heart_eyes:) to talk about concepts and ideas to improve myself and others. My carrer is mainly focused in Backend Development for Cloud and Security aspects of software. 

I really like to clarify things and make it them maintenable and readable for others.

A lover of geek things like Star Wars, so expect to see hear phrases like "The force is strong in your code" or even "Do it" for specific ideias.

Currently working deeply with Golang(GO) and Security :closed_lock_with_key:
